# Human Decision Under Uncertainty
This repository explores how humans make decisions under uncertainty using simple AI-inspired models.

# Motivation
Human decisions are often inconsistent and influenced by uncertainty, emotion, and context. 
This project is an early-stage attempt to model such behavior computationally.

# Current Status
This is an early prototype. The logic is intentionally simple and will evolve over time.

## Next Steps
- Log human decisions
- Introduce adaptive decision rules
- Explore learning from past behavior
