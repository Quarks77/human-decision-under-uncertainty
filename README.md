Exploring how humans make decisions under uncertainty using simple AI models

# Human Decision Under Uncertainty
This repository explores how humans make decisions under uncertainty using simple AI-inspired models.

# Motivation
Human decisions are often inconsistent and influenced by uncertainty, emotion, and context. 
This project is an early-stage attempt to model such behavior computationally.

# Current Status
This is an early prototype. The logic is intentionally simple and will evolve over time.

# Next Steps
i. Log human decisions
ii. Introduce adaptive decision rules
iii. Explore learning from past behavior
